Practice 2 
Conclusion
In this practice, after developing a schematic design in KiCad, I learned how to develop a PCB with its components. I
remember, when I searching a little bit about the program, that you could manufacture a board, and thanks to this exercise,
I finally knew how. First, I have to add the components, which, in this case, it was simplified to a couple of modules, in which
I could the components I needed for the design. Then, I exported it and had to rearrange it however I would like, but I prefered to
stick to the one in the description. I had a few issues with the connections, but, in the end, I finished it with a great design.
